# Tic-Tac-Toe 🎮

A classic, fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game built for the web. 

I developed this project specifically to strengthen my core vanilla JavaScript concepts. Moving from backend, terminal-based logic to interactive web interfaces, this game serves as hands-on practice for connecting game state logic directly to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).

## 🧠 Concepts Explored
* **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting HTML elements, updating text dynamically, and toggling CSS classes.
* **Event Handling:** Using `addEventListener` and `forEach` loops to detect user clicks across a grid.
* **State Management:** Tracking player turns (X vs. O), counting moves to detect draws, and managing active/disabled button states.
* **Array Logic:** Iterating through a 2D array of winning patterns to evaluate the game board after every move.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structuring the game board and message containers.
* **CSS3:** Styling the grid, applying a responsive layout using Flexbox, and managing visibility.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Implementing the game logic, win detection, and reset functionality.
